# w3.CSS-Succinctly
W3 Cascade Styles Sheet (CSS) 

W3.CSS is a free, no-license CSS framework from w3schools.com that you can use to produce 
responsive websites that work across all common browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet 
Explorer) and devices (desktops, tablets, mobile). It is much smaller than other frameworks 
and relies only on standard CSS. 

W3.CSS classes 
All the classes in the W3.CSS framework begin with w3-, which reduces the likelihood of 
conflicting style names. You can combine multiple class names in a single class statement, 
allowing you to provide the basic CSS class and add additional features to it. For example, 
the following code will create a w3 container, and set its background color to blue-gray. 

Code Listing 1
<div class="w3-container w3-blue-gray"> 
</div> 
 
You could add the class w3-round-large to add rounded corners to the <div> element.
